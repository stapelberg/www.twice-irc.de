After 13 years of operation, twice-irc is turning down in February 2016.

There are multiple contributing factors to this decision, most importantly that
I, the only remaining operator of the original four, want to largely stop
hosting services. Over the last couple of years, it has become clear that
having just one operator running the network in their spare time isn’t enough
to provide the level of service that would be appropriate. I attribute the fact
that the network ran largely fine for so long to pure good luck :).

At this point, I’d like to thank all channel owners for their confidence in
this network, and hope you can find a great new home for your channels.

Here is an outline of the steps I intend to take:

2016-01-05  Initial turndown announcement published at
	    http://www.twice-irc.de/, the IRC server MOTD and
	    via a global IRC notice
2016-01-30  2 week’s notice is sent out
2016-02-06  1 week’s notice is sent out
2016-02-12  1 day’s notice is sent out
2016-02-13  All DNS records pointing to IRC servers get removed.
            At this point, new users will no longer be able to
	    connect to the network, so you should have migrated
	    your channel by this time.
2016-02-14  All IRC servers get shut down.
2016-02-20  All data (services database) gets deleted from all servers.
2017-01-05  The domain twice-irc.de gets released, at which point
            anyone might register it and point it somewhere else.
	    I strongly advise everyone to have unconfigured twice-irc
	    in their IRC clients by then.

Thank you for your understanding and best wishes,
Best regards,
Michael
